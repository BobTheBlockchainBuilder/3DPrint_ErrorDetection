"""
This is for running the PRNTR's complete operation:
	What to do
		Place .stl file in the code folder
		Check path
		Check the correct camera operation is being used, if using computer use camera.py, if using py use os.systemm(...)
		Check camera.py if using computer --> if the cv2.videocapture is 0 then its builtin webcam, if its 1 then its the connected camera
		Check range values for number of layers --> change in bottomrange & toprange variables below
		Check that 'PRNTR/files/Layer/ideal/image_name.jpg' exists
		Check that 'PRNTR/files/Layer/diffs/diff.jpg' exists
		Run PRNTR.py
		Enter the STL filename
		Answer file deletion question
